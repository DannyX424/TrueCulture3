Gathering the requirements for the project was not simple. Many users would have multiple purposes for the application, and most of those requirements had to be met. Once the requirement was fulfilled, the presentation had to be implemented. The design of the project was thought out and created using Google slides. After the design was created and implemented and the testing phase was successful, the project was ready to be deployed.


While creating the project, the design was how I imagined it. There were tabs that redirected the user between lessons, quizzes and culture history. 
There were many things that went wrong during the creation of the project, one of which was the quizzes were manually created instead of being pulled from the database.
I was lucky when creating the culture tab, I was unsure if it was going to work how I initially thought it would.
I learned how to overcome the many challenges when using MVC. There were times when I was unsure of what steps to take, but I learned to experiment and find many ways to discover the same solution I was looking for.
