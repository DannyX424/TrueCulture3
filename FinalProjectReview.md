Describe project experience including each phase of the SDLC and the project artifacts (design documents, requirements trace, test reports...)
code and architecture walk-through
Gathering the requirements for the project was not simple. Many users would have multiple purposes for the application, and most of those requirements had to be met. Once the requirement was fulfilled, the presentation had to be implemented. The design of the project was thought out and created using Google slides. After the design was created and implemented and the testing phase was successful, the project was ready to be deployed.

lessons learned:

what did you do right?
I managed to create the app, how I wanted to make it, with the major components which included the quiz, and culture section. 

what did you do wrong?
There were many things that went wrong during the creation of the project, one of which was the quizzes were manually created instead of being pulled from the database.

where were you lucky?
I was lucky when creating the culture tab, I was unsure if it was going to work how I initially thought it would.

what would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?
I learned how to overcome the many challenges when using the MVC model. There were times when I was unsure of what steps to take, but I learned to experiment and find many ways to discover the same solution I was looking for. I wish I was able to implement more into my project, such as a profile for the user and randomized quizzes.
